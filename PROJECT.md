# Project Info Page

## Introduction

Over the course of my college years I have applied for many jobs and haven't gotten even many interviews. I have decided I want to make a change this summer 2025 is the the summer I get a job. It will require more work than I've ever put into it before. This is the first step in this process I have a linktree and have used other tools to help people find me and connect around my online presence. But making a website is something I have been wantign to do but haven't yet gotten around to doing. A website will make for a first look into the projects I have built and in and of itself be a good portfolio piece to show off my coding skills. I plan to host different projects I build on the website and to show off my resume with a variety of different certifications and work experiance. I also want to make a blog post every day this summer writing about different things and taking about the whole process. If this doesn't work I don't know what will.

## Part 1: research

Before we get to designing I looked through several porfolios and I wanted to note what I liked about some and what I didn't like about others so I can get an idea of what I want to add to mine. 

#### What things I *didn't* like

- front page is too busy
- there are too many ways to get to the same thing or what seems like two ways to do similar things
- when there were a lot of cool things that demonstrated their ability to code but it made the website too complex
- when the cursor wasn't obvious or hovering over text made it hard to read
- there were times when buttons didn't seem to make scense, the text didn't seem to match up to where they were actually going
- it was weird when it wasn't obvious where to go next
- when buttons weren't made very click friendly, i want a reachtion when i hover and also when i click
- too many links

#### What things I *did* like

- there was a guy who tagged different skills in his portfolio and so that he could show the different things he had done with the skill
- I liked the asthetic of scrolling a lot of the times
- I liked a border that made it easy to go go through the website, it might not be the worst idea to have contact or social information always in front and center.
- I liked illistraitons and the graphics
- when the information on the tab made sense

### What elements should I have?

I also want to research what elements are most important and a whole list of all of the elements a recruiter wants to see on someone's resume/portfolio.

#### According to chatGPT

1. Work Experiance
1. Technical Skills
1. Projects
1. Education
1. Readability/preveiwability
1. GitHub/ Code samples
1. Website
1. Other work contract/internship/freelance
1. certificaitons/bootcamps/courses
1. soft skills and communication

Although there is a little bit of fluff in here I think this will do for now because I am early career I plan to really lean into a porfolio technical skills and educaiton but I will attempt to include a littl bit of all of these elements.
