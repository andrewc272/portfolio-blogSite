# Project Info Page

Over the course of my college years I have applied for many jobs and haven't gotten even many interviews. I have decided I want to make a change this summer 2025 is the the summer I get a job. It will require more work than I've ever put into it before. This is the first step in this process I have a linktree and have used other tools to help people find me and connect around my online presence. But making a website is something I have been wantign to do but haven't yet gotten around to doing. A website will make for a first look into the projects I have built and in and of itself be a good portfolio piece to show off my coding skills. I plan to host different projects I build on the website and to show off my resume with a variety of different certifications and work experiance. I also want to make a blog post every day this summer writing about different things and taking about the whole process. If this doesn't work I don't know what will.
